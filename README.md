### 2. Title of the project: Subcription alert App
### 3. Introduction
  <p>Today, there are many apps that can be used particularly for entertainment like Spotify and Netflix. Not every application is free to use for users though. Spotify, for example, has two versions that are free for users: Spotify Premium and Spotify. Users need to have subscriptions and must be charged to use Spotify Premium. There are many things the human brain cannot remember. Using this mobile application can prevent the cognitive load from occurring. This mobile app is capable of tracking payment and utility service bills that were saved in the database system.</p>
  
  <p>This app works to keep users aware of their payments and utility bills. Firstly, users need to register or sign in to the system. The system then has three user options to use; Add, View, and Update.</p>
  
  <p>There are two separate data categories in this mobile application that can be applied to the system; subscription services and utilities. The aim of categorizing this is to view the data on the View page later. It allows the entry of what users bring into the system.</p>
  
### 4. Objectives
   * To notify and keep track of the bills that users have to pay when the deadline arrives.
   * To allow users to remember the payments they need to make in their everyday lives.
